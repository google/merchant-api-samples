# Google Merchant API C#/.NET Samples

This is a set of simple samples written in C#/.NET, which provide a minimal
example of Google Merchant API integration within a command line application.

## Prerequisites

Please make sure that you're using either

* [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/),
* [Xamarin Studio](https://www.xamarin.com/studio), or
* [MonoDevelop](http://www.monodevelop.com/)

with [NuGet package management](https://www.nuget.org/).
NuGet will handle getting all the dependencies for you with the package
configuration in these projects.

## Setup Authentication and Sample Configuration

If you have not already done so, please read the top-level `README` to discover
how to set up both authentication and the common sample configuration. The rest
of this document assumes you have performed both tasks.

## Running the Samples

We are assuming you've checked out the code and are reading this from a local
directory. If not, check out the code to a local directory and load up the
solution. You will need to
[Restore NuGet Packages](https://docs.nuget.org/ndocs/consume-packages/package-restore)
as well to pull in the dependencies. (The IDEs listed above all support this.)

Before calling any `v1` Merchant API method, you will need to register the GCP
project used to call the APIs. You can do that by running the code sample
`examples/accounts/developerRegistration/v1/RegisterGcpSample.csproj`.
More informations can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/merchant/api/guides/quickstart#register_as_a_developer).

Use the following syntax to run the `ListProductsSample` project, for example.

1. Open a command line and navigate to the samples' root directory (dotnet/)

2. Run
```
dotnet run --project examples/products/v1/ListProductsSample.csproj --framework netcoreapp8.0
```

Examine your shell output, be inspired and start working on an amazing new app!

We hope these samples give you the inspiration needed to create your new
application!
