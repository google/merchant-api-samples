# Google Merchant API C#/.NET Samples

This is a set of simple samples written in C#/.NET, which provide a minimal
example of Google Merchant API integration within a command line application.

## Prerequisites

Please make sure that you're using either

* [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/),
* [Xamarin Studio](https://www.xamarin.com/studio), or
* [MonoDevelop](http://www.monodevelop.com/)

with [NuGet package management](https://www.nuget.org/).
NuGet will handle getting all the dependencies for you with the package
configuration in these projects.

## Setup Authentication and Sample Configuration

If you have not already done so, please read the top-level `README` to discover
how to set up both authentication and the common sample configuration.  The rest
of this document assumes you have performed both tasks.

## Running the Samples

We are assuming you've checked out the code and are reading this from a local
directory. If not, check out the code to a local directory and load up the
solution. You will need to
[Restore NuGet Packages](https://docs.nuget.org/ndocs/consume-packages/package-restore)
as well to pull in the dependencies. (The IDEs listed above all support this.)

1. Build and run any of the included projects.

2. Examine your shell output, be inspired and start hacking an amazing new app!
