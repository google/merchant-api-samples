environment ([read more](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/overview)).

This starter project provides a great place to start your experimentation into
the Google Merchant API for Shopping.

not supported). This means that the samples will use the logged-in user
credentials to authorize the Merchant API requests

1.  Copy/paste the selected sample's code into your Apps Script.

1.  Enable the sample specific [Advanced Service](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/services/advanced#enable_advanced_services). Ensure that you are calling it as specified in the Code Sample

1.  Click "Run" to execute the script. You will be prompted to authorize the script using your own credentials
